# Web-Scraping-and-EDA-with-Python
Python

This project focused on the top 50 companies from the United Kingdom. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

We started by scraping data from Wikipedia using Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. This gave us a comprehensive dataset that includes each company's headquarters location and industry sector, along with their financial figures in billions of US dollars for the year 2021.

Then, we moved on to the exploratory data analysis phase. We used Python's powerful data science libraries, such as pandas and seaborn, to explore the distribution of revenue, profit, assets, and value among these companies. We also analyzed the number of companies in each industry and location, and examined the correlation between different financial variables.

Here are some key insights we found:

The 'Banking' industry has the highest number of companies among the top 50 UK companies.
London has the highest number of companies among the top 50 UK companies.
'Revenue' has a strong positive correlation with 'Profit,' indicating that companies with higher revenue tend to have higher assets.
This project was a great opportunity to practice web scraping and data analysis skills, and it provided valuable insights into the characteristics and performance of the top UK companies.
